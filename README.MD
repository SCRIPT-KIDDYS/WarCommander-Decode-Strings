# TODO:
1. So far nothing. I guess wait to see if there are issues?
2. Drink a beer.

# Usage:

1. Install .net core (This is made with 2.2)
2. Build project.
    - dotnet run
3. Run from command line.
	- This will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    - dotnet WarCommander_Decode_Strings.dll
4. Follow instructions.
5. If you can't understand what this program does, then it is NOT for you.
6. This should work on other games also!
    - You might have to edit code for other games.
